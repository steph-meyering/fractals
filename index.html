                    About Fractals:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fractals are visual expressions of a repeating pattern or 
                    formula that gets progressively more complex.

                    In this project, the Mandelbrot Set is obtained by iterating 
                    over every pixel of the window and performing calculations
                    on it's coordinates.
                    Each pixel's color is computed by performing the same operation hundreds or thousands of times.
                    At higher magnification levels, fractal shapes show more intricate details

                    This binary tree is made up of nodes, each of which has two nested children following a BFS pattern.
                    Every parent node is attached to it's two children by a branch (drawn with Canvas).
                    Use the depth slider to change the amount of nodes generated, and the angle slider
                    to morph the tree into different positions.
